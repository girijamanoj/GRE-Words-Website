There was also less time spent practicing religion.::The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts.::They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans.::Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and artisans emerged.::This group and the rest of the population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two alcaldes.::Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather.::Later, artisans exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.::Music played a special part in all aspects of life and in the evangelization of the natives.::Realizing the musical capacities of the Indians, the Jesuits sent important composers, choir directors, and manufacturers of musical instruments to South America.::The most famous was probably the Italian baroque composer Domenico Zipoli, who worked in the reductions in Paraguay.::Fr.::Johann Mesner and Fr.::Martin Schmid, two Jesuit missionaries with musical talent, went to the Chiquitania.::Schmid in particular was responsible for this skill being developed to such a high degree that polyphonic choirs would perform, and whole orchestras would play Baroque operas on handmade instruments.::He directed the production of violins, harps, flutes, and organs, and wrote and copied masses, operas, and motets.::He built an organ with six stops in Potosí, disassembled it, transported it by mules over a distance of 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) on a difficult road to the remote mission of Santa Ana de Velasco, and re-assembled it there from hand.::It is still is use.::The Jesuits used musical lessons as a first step to the Christianization of the natives.::As Schmid, who also acted as a composer, wrote in a 1744 letter from San Rafael de Velasco: „“...In all these towns the sound of my organs already can be heard.::I made a pile of all kind of musical instruments and taught the Indians how to play them.::Not a single day passes without the sound of songs in our churches... and I sing, play the organ, the zither, the flute, the trumpet, the psalter and the lyre, in high mode and low mode.::All these musical art forms, which I ignored partially, I am able to practice now and teach them to the children of the natives.::Your Reverence would be able to observe here, how children which were torn away from the jungle just a year ago, together with their parents are able today to sing well and with an absolutely firm beat, they play the zither, lyre and the organ and dance with precise movements and rhythm, that they might compete with the Europeans themselves.::We teach these people all these mundane things so they may get rid of their rude customs and resemble civilized persons, predisposed to accept Christianity.”Some Jesuit institutions still exist in the Chiquitania.::For example, the towns of San Rafael de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, Santa Ana de Velasco and San Ignacio de Velasco have functioning town councils (cabildos), and the caciques and the sexton still retain their capacities.::The majority of the population of the Chiquitania is staunchly Catholic; the Chiquitano cosmovision is now only a dimly understood mythology for its inhabitants.::Between 1992 and 2009, the populations of San Xavier and especially Concepción tripled, and more than doubled in San Ignacio de Velasco, now the region’s fastest-growing municipality.::In other mission towns the population also increased, albeit on a smaller scale.::As of 2011, San José de Chiquitos, San Xavier and Concepción have around 10,000 inhabitants each; and San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the Chiquitania, has about 35,000 and is now boasts a campus of a national university.::On the other hand, in Santa Ana de Velasco there are currently only a few hundred people.::The remoter settlements of Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón are quite small as well.::According to various sources, in Bolivia the number of ethnic Chiquitanos is between 30,000 and 47,000  of which less than 6,000 – mainly elderly people – still speak the original language.::Only a few hundred are monolingual in the Chiquitano language.::Economically, the area depends on agriculture.::Maize, rice, yuca, cotton and heart of palm are produced and exported.::Cattle ranching and the industrial processing of milk and cheese have been developed extensively in recent years.::Crafts, often carved of wood using the same techniques as in colonial times, provide additional income.::Since the launch of the Jesuit Mission Circuit – a marketing label to promote regional tourism – in 2005, craftsmanship and tourism have been closely related.::The musical festivals and concerts held regularly in the Chiquitos formermission towns testify to the living heritage of this art form.::Some of the original instruments and sculptures made by Fr.::Martin Schmid and his apprentices survive in small museums in the mission towns, most notably in Concepción which also houses the music archive.::In San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco three original harps from the time of the Jesuits are preserved.::The church in Santa Ana de Vealsco also houses the only original organ in Chiquitos, transported there from Potosí by mule, accompanied by Schmid in 1751.::More than a dozen orchestras and choirs brought together by the Sistema de Coros y Orquestas (SICOR) dot the area.::Since 1996, the nonprofit institution Asociacion Pro Arte y Cultura (APAC) has organized the biennial Festival Internacional de Musica Renacentista y Barroca Americana "MISIONES DE CHIQUITOS".::Starting in 1975, restoration work on the church (now cathedral) of Concepción unearthed more than 5,000 musical scores from the 17th and 18th centuries.::Later another 6,000 scores were found in Moxos and several thousand additionally in San Xavier.::Some of these works have been interpreted at the 2006 and 2008 festivals.::The statistics of these festivals over the years is as follows:The festival is carried out in the designated Plazas Misionales (among other places), usually housed in churches and also in the main plaza of Santa Cruz.::In one event, orchestras of various countries compete against each other.::One of the local orchestras, Orquesta Urubicha, is made up of people native to the ex-missions who use instruments which they build themselves according to plans left by the Jesuit missionaries.::Shortly after the start of the restoration effort, the potential for tourism in the missions was assessed in a report published by UNESCO in 1977.::To promote the missions as a tourist destination, travel agencies, chambers of commerce and industry, the towns' mayors, native communities and other institutions organized the Lanzamiento mundial del Destino Turístico "Chiquitos", Misiones Jesuíticas de Bolivia, a five-day tourist event lasting from March 23–27, 2006.::Journalists and international tour operators were shown the important tourist attractions, and introduced to the culture through visits to museums, local workshops, various concerts, native dances, high masses, processions, crafts festivals, and local cuisine.::The organisers’ goal initially was to raise the number of tourists from 25,000 to 1 million per year over a ten-year period, which would have represented US$400 million of income.::Subsequently, in the face of lack of support from the Bolivian government and the downturn of the national and local economies, a more modest goal of attracting between 200,000 and 250,000 people per annum was established.::Tourism is now an important source of income for the region, amounting in Concepción Municipio alone to US$296,140, or 7.2% of the annual gross production.::An additional US$40,000 or 1% comes from crafts.::According to a report published by the "Coordinadora Interinstitucional de la Provincia Velasco" in 2007, 17,381 people visited San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the region, as tourists in 2006.::About 30% of them came from outside of Bolivia.::The main attraction for tourists are the nearby missions of San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco.::Tourism to San Ignacio de Velasco generated 7,821,450 Bolivianos in income in 2006.::Tourism income is ostensibly translated to improvements in the infrastructure, although there has been criticism that earmarked funds do not always reach their intended destinations.::Other than cultural tourism to the missionary circuit and musical festivals, the region offers many natural attractions like rivers, lagoons, hot springs, caves and waterfalls, although there is no infrastructure to support tourism in this regard.::Many elements of the early days of the Jesuit missions are shown in the movie The Mission, although the movie attempts to depict life in the Guaraní missions of Paraguay, not those of the Chiquitos missions, which were considerably more culturally expressive.::The events around the expulsion of the Jesuits (the Extrañamiento) are depicted in Fritz Hochwälder's play Das heilige Experiment (The Strong are Lonely).::Both are set in Paraguay.::It has been suggested that Das heilige Experiment sparked interest in the 20th century among scholars in the forgotten Jesuit missions.::Jesuit missions in neighboring countriesOf the primary sources, i.e., those composed by the Jesuits themselves during the years 1691 through 1767, those that have been extensively researched (many as yet have not been thoroughly examined) are few.::The most useful is the monumental Historia general de la Compañía de Jesús en la Provincia del Perú: Crónica anómina de 1600 que trata del establecimiento y misiones de la Compañía de Jesús en los países de habla española en la América meridional, vol.::II, edited by Francisco Mateos (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1944).
