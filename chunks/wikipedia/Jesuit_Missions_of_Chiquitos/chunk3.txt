As of 2020, a mortuary chapel (1740), the church (1747), a bell tower (1748), a house for the priests (colegio) and workshops (both 1754) still exist, and were renovated by Hans Roth's restoration project between 1988 and 2003.::Restoration efforts continue.::16°08′04″S 62°01′29″W﻿ / ﻿16.1344°S 62.024696°W﻿ / -16.1344; -62.024696The fourth mission in the World Heritage Site, the mission of

mission was moved three times: in 1707, 1708 and 1722.::The mission was inhabited by the Chiquitanos, the largest tribe in the region.::The mission church was constructed between 1752 and 1756, by Fr.::Martin Schmid and Fr.::Johann Messner.::From 1975 to 1996 the mission was reconstructed as part of Hans Roth's restoration project.::16°41′55″S 60°58′05″W﻿ / ﻿16.6986°S 60.9681°W﻿ / -16.6986;

the mission of San Rafael de Velasco, where the population had grown too large.::The mission church was built between 1752 and 1759, probably by Fr.::Johann Messner, a collaborator with or student of Fr.::Martin Schmid.::The church was restored by Hans Roth between 1979 and 1983.::16°35′03″S 60°41′20″W﻿ / ﻿16.5841°S 60.6888°W﻿ / -16.5841; -60.6888The mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was the final World Heritage Site-inscribed mission to be established.::It was founded by the Jesuit priest Fr.::Julian Knogler in 1755.::The original native inhabitants of the missions were the Covareca and Curuminaca tribes.::The mission church was designed after the expulsion of the Jesuits between 1770 and 1780 by an unknown architect and built entirely by the indigenous population.::The complex, consisting of the church, bell tower, sacristy and a grassy plaza lined by houses, is considered to have the most fidelity to the original plan of the Jesuit reductions.::Starting in 1989 and lasting until 2001, the mission underwent partial restoration through the efforts of Hans Roth and his team.::In their design of the reductions, the Jesuits were inspired by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney.::The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season.::Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once during the time of the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites.::Wood and adobe were the main materials used in the construction of the settlements.::The architecture and internal layout of these missions followed a scheme which was repeated later with some variations in the rest of the missionary reductions.::In Chiquitos, the oldest mission, San Xavier, formed the basis for the organizational style, which consisted of a modular structure, the center formed by a wide rectangular square, with the church complex on one side and the houses of the inhabitants on the three remaining sides.::The centralized organization of the Jesuits dictated a certain uniformity of measures and sizes.::Despite being based on the same basic model, the towns of Chiquitos nonetheless show remarkable variations.::For example, the orientation of the settlements toward the cardinal points differed and was determined by individual circumstances.::The plaza was an almost square area varying in size from 124 by 148 metres (407 ft × 486 ft) in the older towns of San Xavier and San Rafael de Velasco to 166 by 198 metres (545 ft × 650 ft) in San Ignacio de Velasco.::As they were used for religious and civil purposes, these were open spaces free of vegetation except a few palm trees surrounding a cross in the center of the plaza.::The evergreen palm trees symbolizing eternal love, deliberately hearkened to Psalm 92:12.::Four chapels facing the central cross were placed at the corners of the square and were used in processions.::Almost no remains exist of the chapels at the mission sites, as the plazas subsequently were redesigned to reflect the republican and mestizo lifestyle prevalent after the period of the Jesuits.::Most have undergone recent expansion as well.::Trees and shrubs were planted, and in some cases monuments were erected.::Out of the original ten missions, only the plaza at Santa Ana de Velasco does not show major changes, consisting as it did in colonial times, of an open grassy space.::The houses of the natives had an elongated layout, and were arranged in parallel lines extending from the main square in three directions.::Those facing the plaza were originally occupied by the chiefs of the indigenous tribes, and often were larger.::The architecture of these houses was simple, consisting of large rooms (6x4 meters), walls up to 60 centimetres (2 ft) thick, and a roof made of reed (caña) and wood (cuchi) that reached a height of 5 m (16 ft) in the center.::Double doors and open galleries provided protection from the elements.::The latter have had a social function as meeting places up to the present day.::Over the last 150 years, this layout has been replaced by the usual Spanish colonial architecture of large square blocks with internal patios.::Remnants of the initial design can still be seen in San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, places that were not as much exposed to modernization as the other settlements.::Along the fourth side of the plaza lay the religious, cultural and commercial centers of the towns.::In addition to the church, which dominated the complex, there would have been a mortuary chapel, a tower and a colegio or "school", connected by a wall along the side of the plaza.::Behind the wall and away from the plaza would have been the patio with living quarters for the priests or visitors, rooms for town council matters, for music and storage, as well as workshops, which often were arranged around a second patio.::Behind the buildings, a vegetable garden surrounded by a wall and a cemetery likely would have been found.::The cemeteries and workshops have disappeared completely from the mission settlements, while the other elements of the church complex still survive to varying degrees.::Two stone towers (in San Juan Bautista and San José de Chiquitos) and one of adobe (in San Miguel de Velasco) can be traced back to the time of the Jesuits.::Others are of more recent construction, or the result of the conservation and restoration work spearheaded by Roth toward the end of the 20th century.::Many of these are tall wooden constructions open on all sides.::Of the Jesuit schools only those in San Xavier and Concepción are preserved entirely.::Like the houses of the indigenous residents, the buildings of the church complex were single-level ones.::Once a settlement had been established, the missionaries, working with the native population, began to erect the church, which served as the educational, cultural and economic center of the town.::The initial church in each mission (except in Santa Ana de Velasco) was temporary, essentially no more than a chapel and built as quickly as possible of local wood, unembellished save for a simple altar.::The Jesuit masterpieces seen today general were erected several decades into the settlements’ existence.::Fr.::Martin Schmid, Swiss priest and composer, was the architect for at least three of these missionary churches: San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco, and Concepción.::Schmid combined elements of Christian architecture with traditional local design to create a unique baroque-mestizo style.::Schmid placed a quotation from the Genesis 28:17 above the main entrance of each of the three churches.::In San Xavier the quotation is in Spanish: CASA DE DIOS Y PUERTA DEL CIELO ; and in Latin at the other two churches: DOMUS DEI ET PORTA COELI, meaning The house of god and the gate of heaven.::The construction of the restored churches seen today falls in the period between 1745 and 1770 and is characterized by the use of locally available natural materials like wood, used in the carved columns, pulpits and sets of drawers.::Artistic adornments were added even after the Jesuits’ expulsion in 1767, until around 1830.::Some of the altars are covered in gold.::Often the walls of the mission churches were made of adobe, the same material that had been used for the houses of the natives.::In San Rafael de Velasco and San Miguel de Velasco, mica also was used on the walls, giving them an iridescent effect.::The construction of the church in San José de Chiquitos is an exception: inspired by an unknown baroque model, it has a stone façade.::The only other example where stone was used on a grand scale is in the construction of San Juan Bautista, although only the ruins of a tower remain.::All of the churches consist of a wooden skeleton with columns, fixed in the ground, which provided stability to the building and supported the tile-covered roof.::The adobe walls were placed directly on the ground, virtually independent of the wooden construction, and had no supporting role.::Porticos and a large porch roof provided protection from the heavy tropical rains.::The floor was covered in tiles which, like those of the roof, were produced in local tile works.::The churches have a barn-like appearance, albeit of monumental size (width: 16–20 metres (52–66 ft), length: 50–60 metres (160–200 ft) height: 10–14 metres (33–46 ft)) with a capacity for more than 3,000 people, with a wide structure and distinctive low-hanging eaves.::This style also is evident in the building method of native community houses.::The construction of the church required a major effort by the community and employed hundreds of indigenous carpenters.
