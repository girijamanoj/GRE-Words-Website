Fr.::José Cardiet described the process:All these buildings are made in a different way of those made in Europe: because the roof is built first and the walls afterwards.::First large tree trunks are buried in the soil, these are worked by adz.::Above these they place the beams and sills; and above these the trusses and locks, tins and roof; after that the foundations of stone are placed, and about 2 or 3 spans above the surface of the soil, and from here upwards they place the walls of adobe.::The wooden trunks or pillars, which are called horcones, remain in the central part of the walls, carrying the complete weight of the roof and no weight on the walls.::In the central naves and in the place where the wall will be placed, 9 feet deep holes are made, and with architectural machines they introduce the carved horcones in the form of columns.::The 3 meters (9 feet) stay inside the soil and are not carved, and keep part of the trees roots for greater strength, and these parts are burned so they may resist the humidity.The walls were decorated with cornices, moldings, pilasters and at times blind arcades.::First the walls were plastered entirely by a mix of mud, sand, lime and straw, both inside and outside.::Paint in earth tones was applied over the lime whitewash, and ornaments were drawn, featuring elements from flora and fauna, as well as angels, saints and geometrical patterns.::As noted above, in some cases mica was used to decorate the walls, columns and woodworks.::Large oval "oeil-de-boeuf" windows, surrounded by relief petals, above the main doors are a characteristic feature.::The churches had three aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted fluting resembling those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome.::Until modern times, there were no pews so the congregation had to kneel or sit on the floor.::A variety of fine pieces of art adorn the inside of the churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica.::Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of brightly painted wood and supported by carved sirens.::The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation.::Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations.::The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples.::There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted.::These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of the reductions in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands.::The tradition of figure carving has been preserved to the present day in workshops where carvers make columns, finials and windows for new or restored churches or chapels in the area.::In addition, carvers produce decorative angels and other figures for the tourist market.::The missionary churches are the true architectural highlights of the area.::Hans Roth initiated an important restoration project in these missionary churches in 1972.::In San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco, San José de Chiquitos, Concepción, San Miguel de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, these churches have undergone meticulous restoration.::In the 1960s, the San Ignacio de Velasco church (a non-current UNESCO WHS) was replaced with modern construction; in the 1990s, Hans Roth and his co-workers brought the restoration as close as possible to the original edifices.::In addition to the churches, Roth constructed more than a hundred new buildings, including schools and houses.::He also founded museums and archives.::Roth researched and recovered the original techniques used to construct churches prior to the restorations.::He installed new building infrastructure including saw mills, locksmith shops, and carpentry and repair shops, and trained local people in traditional crafts.::European volunteers, non-profit organizations, the Catholic Church, and the Bolivian Learning Institute (IBA) helped in the project.::Roth convinced the local inhabitants of the importance of the restoration works, which required a large labor force: typically 40 to 80 workers in towns with populations of 500 to 2,000 were required for church restoration.::The effort indicates the strength of and commitment to the unique shared heritage present in the towns.::This restoration has resulted in a revival of local traditions and a qualified workforce.::The reductions were self-sufficient indigenous communities of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions and played the role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits.::However, the degree to which the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.::The Jesuits quickly learned the languages of their subjects, which eased the missionary work and contributed to the success of the missions.::Although initially each mission were conceived as home to one specific tribe, numerous tribal families lived in the Chiquitania, and often were gathered in next to each other on the same mission.::According to a report from 1745, of the 14,706 people living in the missions, 65.5% spoke Chiquitano, 11% Arawak, 9.1% Otuquis, 7.9% Zamucos, 4.4% Chapacura and 2.1% Guaraní.::It should, however, be understood that by this time most of the inhabitants of these missions spoke Chiquitano as a second language.::Such ethnic diversity is unique among the Jesuit missions in America.::Reflecting the view of the colonial powers, the Jesuit records only distinguished between Christian and non-Christian Indios.::Eventually Gorgotoqui, the formal name for language spoken by the Chiquitano tribe, became the lingua franca of the mission settlements, and the numerous tribes were culturally united in the Chiquitano ethnic group.::By 1770, within three years of the expulsion of the Jesuits, Spanish authorities instituted a new policy of forced "castilianization" or "Hispanicization" of the language, thereby causing the number of speakers of native languages to decline.::Many Indians who joined the missions were looking for protection from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores.::In the reductions, the natives were free men.::The land in the missions was common property.::After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families.::For the Jesuits, the goal was always the same: to create cities in harmony with the paradise where they had encountered the indigenous peoples.::Though the settlements were officially a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru through the Royal Audiencia of Charcas and of the diocese of Santa Cruz in church affairs, their remoteness made them effectively autonomous and self-sufficient.::As early as 1515, the Franciscan friar Bartolomé de las Casas had initiated a "foreigner law" for the "'Indian people'", and no white or black man, other than the Jesuits and authorities, was allowed to live in the missions.::Merchants were allowed to stay for three days at most.::Traditionally most of the Chiquitos tribes practiced swidden agriculture, growing maize and yuca on a small scale.::After contact with the Spanish, cocoa and rice also were cultivated.::Hunting and fishing provided additional nutrition in the dry season.::The Jesuits introduced cattle breeding.::In each settlement, one of the Jesuits was responsible for church matters, while another dealt with commercial affairs and the general well-being of the community.::As the Swiss priest, musician and architect Fr.::Martin Schmid wrote in a 1744 letter from San Rafael: „...the Missionary Priests... are not only parish priests who have preach, hear confessions and govern souls, they are also responsible for the life and health of their parishioners and must provide all the things needed by their towns, because the soul cannot be saved if the body dies.::Therefore, the missionaries are town counsellors and judges, doctors, bleeders, masons, carpenters, ironsmiths, locksmiths, shoemakers, tailors, millers, backers, cooks, shepherds, gardeners, painters, sculptors, turners, carriage makers, brick makers, potters, weavers, tanners, wax and candle makers, tinsmiths, and any artisans which may be required in a republic.“ The Jesuits administered labor, the introduction of new technologies, and the disposition of goods.::They designated that each family receive all that was necessary to live.::The Jesuits did not rely on donations, because by right the priests received a fixed income (usually insufficient for their needs) from the community to support their work.::The thriving economy in the reductions enabled them to export surplus goods to all parts of Upper Peru, although ironically not to Paraguay – the region the Jesuits most wanted to reach.::The income was used to pay royal tributes and to purchase goods not locally available, such as books, paper, and wine, from as far away as Europe.::In the missions themselves money was not used.::This laid the foundation of the belief that the Jesuits were guarding immense riches acquired through local labor.::In reality the communities were economically successful but hardly constituted any important source of income for the Jesuit order.::All the inhabitants, including the young and elderly, were subject to a schedule of alternating work, religious practice, and rest.::According to d'Orbigny, the inhabitants of the Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably more freedom than those in the Mojos missions.
