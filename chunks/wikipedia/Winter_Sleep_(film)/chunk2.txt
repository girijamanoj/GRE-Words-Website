Only one man, the obsequious imam, makes a concerted effort to get along with him, although Aydin is annoyed by his flattering talk and insincere, teeth-baring grins, and obliquely insults him in his newspaper column.::Aydın's comfort is, however, "challenged  by the conversations that ensue between him and the poor family, his wife and his sister on topics ranging from civic responsibility to evil".::The film won the Palme d'Or at the 67th Cannes Film Festival.::The longest film in competition by far, Winter Sleep's Palme d'Or marked the culmination of the career of Nuri Bilge Ceylan, who has twice received the festival's second-place honor, the Grand Prix (for 2002's Uzak and for 2011's Once Upon a Time in Anatolia) and who won a directing prize for 2008's Three Monkeys.::Nuri Bilge Ceylan also won the award for Achievement in Directing for the film at the 2014 Asia Pacific Screen Awards.::Ceylan said in his acceptance speech that it was "a great surprise" when he took the stage, noting that it was perhaps a fitting choice in a year that marked the 100th anniversary of Turkish cinema.::Tacitly acknowledging the 2013–14 protests in Turkey that led to the deaths of 11 people, the director said, "I want to dedicate the prize to all the young people of Turkey, including those who lost their lives".::He also mentioned the workers who were killed in the Soma mine disaster, which occurred on the day prior to the commencement of the awards event.::Although it divided critics and audiences with its reams of dialogue and challenging 196-minute running time, the film became an early critics’ favorite and Palme d'Or contender when it screened on the festival's third day.::The film was selected as the Turkish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.::
