The Lamborghini Gallardo (/ɡaɪˈjɑːrdoʊ/; Spanish: [ɡaˈʎaɾðo]) is a sports car built by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini from 2003 to 2013.::It is Lamborghini's best-selling model with 14,022 built throughout its production run.::Named after a famous breed of fighting bull,  the V10 powered Gallardo has been Lamborghini's sales leader and stable-mate to a succession of V12 flagship models—first to the  Murciélago (4,099 built between 2001 and 2011), then to the current flagship, the Aventador.::On 25 November 2013, the last Gallardo was rolled off the production line.::The Gallardo was replaced by the Huracán in 2014.::The first generation of the Gallardo was powered with an even firing 4,993 cc (5.0 L) 90 degree V10 engine generating a maximum power output of 500 PS (368 kW; 493 hp) at 7500 rpm and 510 N⋅m (376 lb⋅ft) of torque at 4500 rpm.::The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-pattern) six-speed manual transmission, and a more advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically actuated single-clutch automated manual transmission, similar to a Formula One style single-clutch sequential gearbox, which Lamborghini abbreviates to "E-gear".::The "E-gear" allows the driver to change gears much faster than they could with a manual transmission.::The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode via the gear selector located in place of the gear shift lever.::The vehicle was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and was based on the 1995 Calà prototype designed by Italdesign Giugiaro.::For the 2006 model year (launched in late 2005), Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners.::The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter during city driving), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20 PS to a maximum of 520 PS (382 kW; 513 hp), and the biggest change was overall lower gearing ratios, especially in 1st to 5th gear.::These changes gave the car much better performance than the original.::These changes were also included in the limited edition Gallardo SE.::The Lamborghini Concept S is a concept car based on the Gallardo, featuring a speedster (Barchetta) body designed by Luc Donckerwolke.::It was built in 2005 and was first shown at that year's Geneva Motor Show.::The Concept S was intended to be a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past.::Utilising a 'saute-vent' (French for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5.0 L V10 engine, giving the car a distinctly futuristic look along with increasing aerodynamic flow.::The rear-view mirror is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or to retract it into the dashboard when not needed.::Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs.::Lamborghini was rumoured to be building 100 examples for customers, but decided to keep it as a styling exercise.::Only 2 cars were produced: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event "Driven by Disruption".::It was expected to sell for US$2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell.::The convertible variant of the Gallardo, called the Gallardo Spyder, was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006.::It was considered by the company to be an entirely new model, with the engine having a power output of 520 PS (382 kW; 513 hp) and a low-ratio six-speed manual transmission.::The Spyder has a retractable soft-top.::At the 2007 Geneva Auto Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Gallardo Superleggera.::The name paid tribute to the construction style of the first Lamborghini production model, the 350 GT, designed and built by Carrozzeria Touring and its emphasis on weight reduction.::The Superleggera is lighter than the base model by 100 kg (220 lb) due the use of carbon fibre panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts and carbon fibre sports seats.::The engine power was uprated by 10 PS (7 kW; 10 hp) courtesy of an improved intake, exhaust and ECU for a total power output of 530 PS (390 kW; 523 hp).::The 6-speed E-Gear transmission was standard on US spec models with the 6-speed manual transmission offered as a no cost option.::Production of the Superleggera amounted to 618 units worldwide.::In December 2004, two Gallardos were donated to the Italian Polizia di Stato in honour of the force's 152nd anniversary.::One car was donated by Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. while a second one was donated by an independent organisation.::The Gallardo police cars were used by the traffic police (Polizia Stradale) during emergencies and alarm situations on the Salerno-Reggio Calabria highway, also under the powers of the special safety operative which is already being employed along that tract of highway and, above all, for the transport of body organs destined for transplantation.::However, both of the cars were destroyed in the course of duty.::When the Huracán, Gallardo's successor, was introduced, Lamborghini S.p.A produced a personalised version for the Italian police force serving as the replacement of the destroyed cars.::Two Gallardos have been "temporary" police cars for the Metropolitan Police in London, one in 2005 and one in 2006, for specific publicity events.::The car used in 2006 was seen at the start of the 2006 Gumball Rally.::Both vehicles were lent by Lamborghini London and were fitted with yellow and blue battenburg markings, police logos and a small blue lightbar.::The Gallardo SE is a limited edition of 250 units introduced in 2005.::It is distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by a black-roofed two-tone color scheme as well as specially designed "Callisto" wheels.::It also featured a two-tone interior further distinguishing it from the base model.::All piping and stitching on the leather are executed in the same colour as the bodywork of the car.::The midsections of the seats are finished in colour-coded upholstery and even the black floormats have a colour-coded border.::A rear-view camera was standard on the Gallardo SE, as was the multimedia and navigation system, sports suspension and an exclusive cover.::The optional E-gear transmission came with a new function: 'thrust' mode.::This feature automatically revs the car to 5,000 rpm then drops the clutch engaging all four wheels in a controlled burnout to ensure that the car performs maximum acceleration.::The Gallardo Nera is a special edition (limited to 185 units) of the Gallardo and was introduced at the Paris Motor Show.::The car was designed to showcase the customization options available to the customer in the Ad Personam program.::It features special matte black body panels and was only available in a special shade of black: a combination of Nero Serapis and Nero Noctis.::Brake calipers are painted a special silver and the taillights are smoked to match the darker paint scheme.::The interior is stitched from high-contrast black and white leather in the Q-Citura (lozenge shaped) fashion.::In 2007, the Gallardo was entered in the FIA GT3 Championship, built by German motorsport specialists Reiter Engineering, who previously manufactured the Murciélago R-GT and the Diablo GTR Super Trophy race cars.::All the extra aerodynamic components were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart.::Brembo racing brakes and OZ Racing wheels were also added.::It was converted to rear wheel drive, other than when racing in the one-make Lamborghini Super Trofeo.::The engine generated a maximum power output of 520 PS (382 kW; 513 hp) at 7,800 rpm and 510 N⋅m (376 lb⋅ft) of torque at 4,500 rpm.::In 2007, the Gallardo was entered by Japan Lamborghini Owners Club (JLOC) to the GT300 class of the Japanese Super GT Championship, the car had to conform to rather different regulations.::The engine could only have a power output of 300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp) and the car must be rear-wheel-drive.::The power was limited by air restrictors placed in the engine bay.::The gearbox is a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup.::The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing.::It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.::Lamborghini recalled about 1,500 Gallardo Coupé and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, because of the possibility of power steering fluid leaking and the risk of fire.::The cars were built from May 2003 through April 2008.::Presented at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, the Gallardo LP 560-4 was a significant update of the Gallardo, powered by a new, uneven firing 5.2 L (5,200 cc; 320 cu in) V10 engine that produces 560 PS (412 kW; 552 hp) at 8,000 rpm and 540 N⋅m (398 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,500 rpm.::Featuring "Iniezione Diretta Stratificata" direct fuel injection system to improve efficiency; fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have been reduced by 18% despite the increase in performance.::The car was redesigned, inspired by the Murciélago LP 640 and Reventón.::The new engine, 40 PS (29 kW; 39 hp) more powerful than in the previous car, comes with two transmission choices: a 6-speed manual or 6-speed E-gear, the latter of which was revised to offer a Corsa mode which makes 40% quicker shifts than before and decreases traction control restrictions, a Thrust Mode launch control system was also added.
