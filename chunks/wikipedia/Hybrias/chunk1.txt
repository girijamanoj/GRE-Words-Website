Hybrias (Greek: Ὑβρίας) (fl.::6th century BC) was a Cretan mercenary and lyric poet.::He was the author of a highly esteemed skolion (drinking song), called the spear-song, which has been preserved by Athenaeus (XV, pp.::695–696), Eustathius of Thessalonica (Commentary on the Odyssey, p. 47 & p. 276) and the Greek Anthology.::In this piece, Hybrias proclaimed himself a great warrior: "I have great wealth — a spear, a sword and a fine shield to save my skin.::With these I plough, I reap, I tread the sweet grapes and am called master of my serfs.::All those that dare not hold the spear and sword and fine shield to save their skin, all bow and kiss my knee, calling me master and great king".::
