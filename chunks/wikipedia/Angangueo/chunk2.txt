The slides forced the evacuation of hundreds, due to the danger of more slides.::The Topos de Tlatelolco assisted with the search for survivors and bodies.::At least 1,000 persons were made homeless and moved to a shelter in San José del Rincón, Mexico State.::Many houses built on the riverbanks were swept away.::At least thirty were killed by the event in the town alone.::Bodies were found in the municipal seat and in smaller communities such as Salitre.::2,500 people lost everything in the disaster.::President Calderón visited the disaster area and toured some of the attractions, both on the ground and by air.::He was accompanied by Michoacan's governor Leonel Godoy to survey the damage.::As an alternative to mining, Calderón suggested developing tourism in Angangueo as a Pueblo Mágico.::However, residents demanded the assurance that the town would not disappear, and that jobs would be available.::According to the director of the Forest Commission of Michoacan, Alejandro Méndez, deforestation from legal and illegal logging contributed to the landslides in 2010.::In addition, cleared areas on hillsides were used to build homes.::The landslides in Angangueo and in other areas such as Zamora have prompted studies by government authorities as to the causes of these events as well as the emergency responses.::Later in February, federal authorities announced that no new residents could move into the town and that the current population would be relocated.::The decision was made with the rationale that the landslides create too big a hazard for people to live in the current location and a “New Angangueo” would be built.::However, local residents were against the plan.::Efforts to relocate the town were officially begun in June 2010, with a projected 600 homes in a location called Barrio Sustentable Monarca.::The construction was halted by September of the same year, with only a layout traced on the site and no new homes started.::As tourism is being exploited, the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve runs higher risks of being disturbed as thousands of tourists walk the trails around the forest habitats of the butterfly each year.::While the resident population demands other sources for economic stability, the government is implementing methods to boost tourism.::No efforts have been made to officially moderate the physical establishments, entertainment, noise and vehicles which are prominently growing in the biosphere area.::
