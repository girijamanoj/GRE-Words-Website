South Africa was the only country other than the UK to operate the Buccaneer, where it was in service with the SAAF from 1965 to 1991.::In January 1963, even before the S.2 entered squadron service, South Africa had purchased 16 Spey-powered Buccaneers.::The order was part of the Simonstown Agreement, in which the UK obtained use of the Simonstown naval base in South Africa, in exchange for maritime weapons.::An order for a further 20 Buccaneers was blocked by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson's government.::In the maritime strike role, SAAF Buccaneers were armed with the French radio-guided AS-30 missile.::In March 1971, Buccaneers fired 12 AS-30s at a stricken tanker, the Wafra, but failed to sink it.::The AS-30 missile was also used in ground attacks for effective precision strikes, one example being in 1981, when multiple missiles were used to strike a number of radar stations in southern Angola.::For overland attack, the SAAF Buccaneers carried up to four 1,000-pound (450Â kg) bombs in the rotary bomb bay, and four bombs, flares, or SNEB rocket packs on the underwing stores pylons.::During the 1990s, it was revealed that South Africa had manufactured six air-deliverable tactical nuclear weapons between 1978 and 1993.::These nuclear weapons, containing highly enriched uranium, with an estimated explosion yield of 10-18 kilotons, were designed for delivery by either the Buccaneer or the Canberra bomber.::SAAF Buccaneers saw active service in the 1970s and 1980s during the South Africa Border War, frequently flying over Angola and Namibia, launching attacks upon SWAPO guerilla camps.::During a ground offensive, Buccaneers would often fly close air support (CAS) missions armed with anti-personnel rockets, as well as performing bombardment operations.::Buccaneers played a major role in the Battle of Cassinga in 1978, being employed in repeated strikes upon armoured vehicles, including enemy tanks, and to cover the withdrawal of friendly ground forces from the combat zone.::The Buccaneer was capable of carrying heavy load outs over a long range, and could remain in theatre for longer than other aircraft, making it attractive for the CAS role.::On 3 January 1988 Buccaneers of the SADF destroyed the important bridge across the Cuito River using a Raptor glide bomb, following on from a less successful attempt on 12 December 1987.::Only five aircraft remained operational by the time the Buccaneer was retired from service in 1991.::Early in the Buccaneer programme, the US Navy had expressed mild interest in the aircraft, but quickly moved on to the development of its comparable Grumman A-6 Intruder.::The West German Navy showed a greater interest, and considered replacing its Hawker Sea Hawks with the type, although it eventually decided on the Lockheed F-104G for its maritime strike requirement, following the bribing of West German government officials in the Lockheed bribery scandals.::At one point, a total of three privately owned Buccaneers were being operated at Thunder City.::In the United Kingdom, Buccaneer S.2 XX885 is being rebuilt to flying condition by Hawker Hunter Aviation.::It was granted UK CAA permission to fly in April 2006.::A number of Buccaneers in the UK are in fast taxiing condition, and several more are being rebuilt to taxiing condition.::Data from The Observer's Book of Aircraft, Aeroguide 30: Blackburn Buccaneer S Mks.::1 and 2General characteristicsPerformanceArmamentAvionicsBlue Parrot ASV search/attack radarAircraft of comparable role, configuration and eraRelated lists::
