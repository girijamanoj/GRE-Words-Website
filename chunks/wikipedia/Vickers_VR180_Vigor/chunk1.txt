The Vickers VR180 Vigor was a British crawler tractor, built from 1951 to 1958 by Vickers-Armstrongs.::During World War II, the company gained substantial experience in the design and construction of tanks and continuous track vehicles.::After the war they developed a civilian crawler tractor that could be sold for use in peacetime reconstruction work.::It was notable for the unusual sophistication of its chassis.::The Vigor was built at the Scotswood, Newcastle-upon-Tyne works.::The tractor's most distinctive feature was its running gear: four full height roadwheels also acting as rear drive sprocket, front idler and track return rollers.::This was the same layout as the Tetrarch light tank, which Vickers-Armstrongs had developed in the 1930s.::In common with tanks of this period, but in contrast to crawler tractors, the suspension had considerable articulation and permitted high speeds.::The Vigor was capable of nearly 10 mph, while the comparable Caterpillar D8 could only reach 5 mph.::The four roadwheels were linked as two bogies on each side.::Pairs of bogies on opposite sides were linked by an articulated beam with a centre tilt pivot.::This suspension required a flexible track, developed by Vickers, with rubber sealing washers between the moving parts.::Wear to the rubber in service could make the track floppy, a drawback to the design.::Together with the sophisticated suspension articulation, if not well-maintained, the Vigor was prone to throwing tracks when run at speed.::Vehicle chassis was fabricated in two pieces, mainly from large iron or steel castings.::The nose of early models was distinctively solid and sloped, while other makers had a vertical radiator grille.::Later models, after experience in Australia, also gained a lightweight steel grille for better ventilation.::The chassis unbolted relatively quickly, two hours being cited, into front (engine) and rear (transmission) components.::The engine was a Rolls-Royce C6SFL 12.17l six-cylinder supercharged diesel.::This engine was more powerful than other tractors of this age and weight, with 190 hp at the engine and 150 drawbar hp.::However the fuel consumption was high, at 9.8 gallons per hour at full rate.::The transmission was initially a three-speed manual and high-low-reverse splitter gearbox with a relatively small Borg & Beck 18 inch single plate dry clutch.::This small clutch plate had a reputation for early failure if worked hard.::An improvement from mid-production was the option of a Rolls-Royce hydraulic torque converter, the same converters Rolls-Royce were supplying with the same engines for the new British Rail DMU fleet.::A full range of accessories were offered: front dozer blades with cable or hydraulic lifts, rear ripper blades for breaking virgin bush as farmland in Australia, and a rear logging winch of 30,000 to 50,000 lbf pull.::Production of the VR180 ran from 1952 to 1958, with approximately 1,500 built.::The design continued until 1961 as the Vickers VR110 Vikon with a smaller 142 hp C4SFL four-cylinder engine.::Around 20 Vikon were built, most going to New Zealand.::As for most capital equipment of the early 1950s, the main market was in the Commonwealth: the UK home market could not afford it, particularly with the Austerity Purchase Tax of the time, while the US market preferred domestic products, such as the Caterpillar.::Many Vigors went to Australia, where rough ground capability was appreciated, even though the purchase cost was considerably more than the popular option of war-surplus tanks with turret and roof armour cut away.::A major UK seller was Jack Olding of Hatfield, who relinquished their pre-war Caterpillar dealership in favour of Vickers.::Vigors were also used by the Royal Engineers.::One is on display today in their museum at Gillingham, Kent.::The Vigor chassis became a distinctive feature of Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds TV series.::Many of the pod-carried land vehicles used by Thunderbird 2 such as Firefly and the carrier vehicle for The Mole were based on the Vigor.::A  1/16 scale plastic model kit of the period by Victor Models of Guildford represented the Vigor; in typical Gerry Anderson style, a plastic kit that was available and affordable, but rare enough to be different and not obviously recognisable.::
