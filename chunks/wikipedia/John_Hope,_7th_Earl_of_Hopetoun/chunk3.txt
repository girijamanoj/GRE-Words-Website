Hopetoun and his family left Australia from Brisbane on 17 July 1902, at which point Lord Tennyson, Governor of South Australia, took over as Administrator of the Government.::Still very popular with the Australian public, there were elaborate and tearful farewell ceremonies in Melbourne and Sydney.::Upon Hopetoun's return to Britain, King Edward VII recognised his service by bestowing upon him the title of Marquess of Linlithgow, in the county of Linlithgow or West Lothian, on 23 October 1902.::However among observers, and particularly Hopetoun himself, "there was little doubt that he had been less than successful in the great test of his public career".::In the wake of his resignation, Alfred Deakin provided an explanatory editorial under alias for the British public in The Morning Post: "Our first Governor General may be said to have taken with him all the decorations and display and some of the anticipations that splendidly surrounded the inauguration of our national existence...we have...revised our estimate of high office, stripping it too hastily, but not unkindly, of its festal trappings.::The stately ceremonial was fitting, but it has been completed."::Though he greatly desired appointment to the Viceroyalty of India, Linlithgow was prevented from attaining the position by poor health and adverse political developments, though his son Victor, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, would eventually assume this role (after rejecting the post of Australian Governor-General in 1935) from 1936 to 1943.::His grandson Lord Glendevon married the daughter of the English novelist W. Somerset Maugham.::His final political appointment was to that of Secretary for Scotland during the last months of the ministry of Arthur Balfour in 1905.::However his political career failed to advance, and still plagued by poor health, he died suddenly of pernicious anaemia at Pau, France, on 29 February 1908.::
