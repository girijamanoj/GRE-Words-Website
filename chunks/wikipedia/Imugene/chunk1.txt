Imugene Ltd is a biotechnology company working in cancer immunotherapy.::The company's lead product is HER-Vaxx, a therapeutic cancer vaccine for the treatment of gastric cancer and breast cancer, where the cancer is HER-2-positive.::Imugene is planning a Phase Ib/II clinical study of HER-Vaxx in gastric cancer which it intends to initiate in 2016.::Imugene stock is publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).::Imugene began as a research project in the laboratory of Professor Ursula Wiedermann at the Medical University of Vienna.::Over the nine years from 2004 Wiedermann et al.::had developed a B cell peptide cancer immunotherapy that could induce an antibody response targeting HER-2 overexpressing tumours.::In 2012 a start-up company called Biolife Science had been incorporated to develop this immunotherapy.::Early-stage funding was secured from Australian and US investors in 2013, after which Biolife was taken public in December 2013 in a reverse takeover of an Australian drug development company called Imugene, whose name was retained after the merger.::Around US$8m was spent on the HER-Vaxx programme prior to its becoming the 'new Imugene'.::HER-Vaxx has been designed as a more effective alternative to the HER-2-targeting monoclonal antibody drugs Herceptin and Perjeta.::In creating HER-Vaxx, Ursula Wiedermann and her colleagues at Medical University of Vienna took the three most immunogenic B cell epitopes from the extracellular domain of HER-2 molecule – called the P4, P6 and P7 antigens – and out of it constructed a peptide vaccine.::P6 and P7 sit at the Herceptin binding site while P4 sits at the Perjeta site.::The vaccine had been intended to be delivered in 'virosomes', that is, influenza virus particles stripped of their disease-causing contents so as to be able to carry peptides instead.::However, in 2015 Imugene announced that it would deliver the vaccine with the diphtheria toxoid CRM197.::The vaccine's developers argue that HER-Vaxx has a number of benefits over the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies.::The vaccine generates a 'polyclonal' rather than a monoclonal antibody response to HER-2 – i.e.::different kinds of antibodies – increasing the chance that cells carrying HER-2 will be killed, particularly those at an earlier stage of disease.::The delivery system helps adjuvant the vaccine, increasing the size of the immune response.::Thirdly, polyclonal antibodies do not appear to have the cardiotoxicity that has been observed in >10% of patients on Herceptin.::The potential for immune memory may mean that the treatment effect is long-lasting (by contrast antibodies have a short half-life – that of Herceptin is only 12 days – meaning that the patient has to have infusions every 1–3 weeks).::The vaccine would be available intra-muscularly, where Herceptin and Perjeta have to be given by regular infusions.::Following on from favourable pre-clinical data, Wiedermann et al.::ran a ten-patient safety study of HER-Vaxx in ten patients with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer, albeit with low HER-2 expression.::This study found the vaccine to be safe, with no observed cardiotoxicity.::The patients developed anti-HER-2 antibodies and in vitro, those anti-HER-2 antibodies showed potent anti-tumour activity.::Also in vitro, blood from the patients carried markers of a cellular immune response such as IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α (meaning that ultimately patients could be expected to develop T cells to kill the cancer cells, and not just antibodies).::The vaccine took down the 'T reg' cell count in the patients, potentially indicating an overcoming of the cancer's immunoresistance.::Imugene has indicated that it intends to run a Phase Ib/II trial in gastric cancer in 2017, in combination with chemotherapy.::The Phase Ib segment of the study would recruit around 15 patients and establish the recommended Phase II dose.::The Phase II segment, a randomised but open label study, would recruit around 68 patients and test for Progression-Free and Overall Survival.::Imugene began as Vos Industries, developer of a new technology for frying food.::This company, which made its initial public offering on the ASX in late 1993, was unsuccessful in commercialising the technology.::The public company shell was then used from 2002 to list an animal vaccine technology venture, at which time the company took the name Imugene, short for 'Immune Genetics'.::This venture was also unsuccessful.::In mid-2012 the company was again restructured, this time to develop a drug delivery technology, however this venture was abandoned at the time of the Biolife Science merger, which was announced on 23 October 2013.::Imugene's executive chairman is Paul Hopper, an Australian bioentrepreneur based in Sydney who was instrumental in identifying the HER-Vaxx project and taking it public in Imugene.::The company's chief operating officer is Leslie Chong, who used to be a Senior Clinical Program Lead at Genentech in San Francisco.::Ursula Wiedermann remains involved as Chief Scientific Officer and Scientific Advisory Board member.::The Imugene board includes Axel Hoos, who as the medical lead in immunology/oncology at Bristol-Myers Squibb developed the melanoma drug Yervoy.::Alongsiode Ursula Wiedermann, Imugene's Scientific Advisory Board is made up of two medical oncologists – Professor Christoph Zielinski of Medical University of Vienna, and Dr Neil Segal of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, whose specialty is gastrointestinal cancers.::Imugene's corporate headquarters are located in Melbourne however Paul Hopper and Leslie Chong live in Sydney.::Imugene's scientific team is located in Vienna.::
