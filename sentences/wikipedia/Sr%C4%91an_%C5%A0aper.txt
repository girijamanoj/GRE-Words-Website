photos in "Vidici" and "Izgled" youth magazines, but when the band included Zdenko Kolar and Boža Jovanović, whom Papić did not like, Papić stopped working with the band.::He did however manage to persuade "Vidici" and "Izgled" to finance the recording of the first single.::Idoli were officially formed on March 1, 1980 at a rehearsal where they wrote some of the most notable songs of that
