Wooley Creek is a large stream in Siskiyou County, California, a tributary of the Salmon River.::Wooley Creek flows 22 miles (35 km) from Man Eaten Lake in the Marble Mountain Wilderness of the Klamath National Forest, in a generally southwest direction, to its confluence with the Salmon River about 4 miles (6.4 km) upstream of the Salmon's confluence with the Klamath River at Somes Bar.::The creek drains an isolated and rugged wilderness area – there are no paved roads and only a few permanent residents in its watershed.::Lower Wooley Creek provides Class IV-V (very difficult) whitewater and is seldom run due to the lack of easy access.::The Wooley Creek Trail provides access along the creek into the wilderness area.::It is one of the few major trails in the area suitable for year-round use due to its low elevation.::
