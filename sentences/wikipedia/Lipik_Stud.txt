The Lipik Stud (Croatian: Ergela Lipik) is a Croatian Lipizzan horse national breeding stud farm located in Lipik, Požega-Slavonia County.::The Stud originated in 1843 as count Izidor Janković built large stables on his estate.::Today it comprises approximately 106 acres in the western part of the Town of Lipik, with a total of 74 horses, 70 of which are Lipizzans.::Founded in 1843 by Count Izidor Janković, Lipik Stud had around twenty horses at the beginning.::In 1906 a new owner, Stjepan Layer from Virovitica, possessed twenty Lipizzan, Nonius and Anglo-Arabian mares and three stallions.::In 1936 the Stud was enlarged with approximately new 60 horses, whereas in 1954 this number increased to approximately 250.::The horse breeding was suddenly interrupted in the late 1960s by the local authorities and it was only in the early 1980s that it began to recover.::During the Croatian Homeland War the Stud ceased to exist.::More than 100 horses, most of them Lipizzans, were taken by the Serbian Army forces to the occupied territory and Serbia, or slaughtered.::After the war, the Stud facilities were renovated and the survived horses were returned from Serbia.::In 2008 the Lipik Stud became the State Stud again and in 2010 it was merged with the Đakovo Stud.::There are five male breeding lines in the Lipik Stud today: Conversano (from 1767), Favory (1779), Neapolitano (1770), Siglavy (1810) and Pluto (1765).::From Favory originates Favory Mara LII-3, the present-day Lipik Stud breeding stallion, foaled in 2004.::The mare lines bred in Lipik are: Batosta, Capriola, Allegra, Trompeta, Gaeta, Gaetana, Bonadea, Monteaura, Wera, Krabbe, Drava, Kitty, Cica and Liza.::The Stud includes four stables, dressage grounds, a fiacres collection and auxiliary buildings (containing barn warehouse, equipment and accessories for employees, souvenir shop etc.).::One of the stables is used for keeping the breeding stallions, the other for mares with new-born foals, the third for yearlings, colts and fillies, and the last one for the equipment for sports competition.::Breeding and selecting, the complete work and care about horses in the Stud is under continued surveillance of experts.::Their objective is to initiate advances in selection and to preserve the genetic potential of the horses, especially of the Lipizzan breed in Croatia.::A particular attention and accent is given to their appearances, movements and behaviour.::The Stud organizes various educational programs and workshops  and is included in tourist routes in Požega-Slavonia County.::Count Izidor Janković, founder of the Lipik StudLipizzans of the Lipik StudHorses on the vast landLipik Stud training ground::
