Virtual TI, or "VTI," is a feature-rich graphing calculator emulator for Microsoft Windows, written in C++ by Rusty Wagner.  It features a graphical debugger, a grayscale display, data transfer between computer and emulated calculator, black-link, parallel link and more.
There are currently two versions available:
Version 2.5 supports the TI-82, 83, 83+, 85, 86, 89, 92, and 92+. Unfortunately, it is unable to properly emulate later versions of the TI-83 Plus, TI-89 and V200 series. It is also unable to emulate the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition as well as the more recent calculators like the TI-84 Plus.
Version 3.0 supports the TI-73, 83+, and the 83+ SE so far. However, it cannot retrieve the image of a TI-84+, and any file other than Apps cannot be loaded. It also doesn't allow users to save its state.
Virtual TI requires a calculator ROM image. The program itself can extract ROM images from TI calculators via Serial or Parallel connection.
This software has not been updated for several years, unlike TiEmu.
