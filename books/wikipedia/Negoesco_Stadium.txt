Negoesco Stadium is a 3,000 seat soccer stadium located in San Francisco, on the campus of University of San Francisco. Named for USF Soccer Coach Steve Negoesco. It is the home field for the men's and women's soccer teams. Negoesco is also the primary home field for  San Francisco City FC of the Premier Development League. The stadium is also used by USF students and staff for recreational activities.
The stadium was renovated in 2000 expanding it to its current capacity of 3,000 seats including theater style seats on the west side of the field and a full permanent grandstand on the east side. Additionally TV capable lights were added to the field that year. In 2003 the current fieldturf surface was added.
Negoesco has also hosted a US Open Cup game between the Los Angeles Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer and an international friendly between the Earthquakes and Shanghai Shenhua of the Chinese Super League.
Some of the most notable improvements were made in September 2008, just before the Dons began their season, as banners celebrating the rich legacy and tradition of USF Soccer were hung along the stadiums west wall. Six national championship banners hang alongside 2 national runner-up banners and alongside banners celebrating the Dons glorious postseason past (30 NCAA appearances, 9 College Cup appearances).  Additional banners also feature USF conference titles as members of the Northern California Intercollegiate Soccer Conference/West Coast Intercollegiate Soccer Conference, Pacific Soccer Conference, and the West Coast Conference. A final banner will feature the names of all 41 NSCAA All-Americans to proudly wear the Green and Gold.
Other changes include the installation of advertising panels acknowledging sponsors and supporters of USF Athletics and the Dons Soccer program alongside the east sideline of the field, and European-style protective team benches, were also added to the technical areas on the east sideline.
