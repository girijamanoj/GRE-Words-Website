A market stall is a typically immobile, temporary structure erected by merchants to display and shelter their merchandise in a street market or other setting.  Stalls are relatively easy to erect and take down. Some stalls are mobile, and have wheels. There are many types of stalls, from carts designed to be pulled by hand or cycles; makeshift structures like tents, or converted tow-caravans and motor vehicles. 
Some commercial marketplaces, including market squares or flea markets, may erect (or allow merchants to erect) more permanent stalls.
Stalls are used throughout the world by vendors selling street food.
Stalls are also used as a display area at fairs and conventions.
