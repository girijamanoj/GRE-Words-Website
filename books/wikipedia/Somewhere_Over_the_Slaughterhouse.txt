Somewhere over the Slaughterhouse is the sixth studio album by Buckethead. To date it is his only solo album to be released as both a CD and LP and is currently out of print. Problems with rights ownership make a reissue unlikely. A download can be obtained at TDRS Music.
The title track features an intentionally mangled rendition of the song  "Over the Rainbow", popularly known as "Somewhere over the Rainbow", from the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, as sung by the main character Dorothy Gale portrayed by Judy Garland. It is the inspiration for the title of the track, and thereby the album.
